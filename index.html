          <p><strong>Background</strong></p>
          <img src="images/grandma-gym.PNG" alt="" class="grandma-gym" />
          <p class="shit">
            Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) causes a slight but noticeable
            decline in mental abilities, such as memory loss and impaired
            thinking. People with MCI have a much higher risk of going on to
            develop dementia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previous research has shown that regular exercise may help improve
            brain health and prevent dementia. This study is comparing the
            effectiveness of three different kinds of exercise on memory and
            thinking abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This study seeks men and women aged 60+ who have noticed a slight
            decline in their memory and/or other mental abilities. Participants
            will be randomly assigned to one of three different exercise
            training groups: a) Strength training group, b) Aerobic training
            group, or c) Balance, toning & mobility training group. Participants
            will be invited to attend 3 supervised exercise sessions per week
            for 12 months at the research site in Lidcombe.
